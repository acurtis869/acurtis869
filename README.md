## Welcome to my GitHub

I am a passionate data analyst currently working at GLL in the Business Insights team in London. I have several years of professional experience within data and hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Bath and a Master's in Data Science from the University of St Andrews. My educational background has equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematical concepts and data science methodologies, which I apply to solve complex problems and derive actionable business insights. I enjoy learning and am committed to further self-development, currently working towards Microsoft Azure Data Engineering Certification. 

## Current Projects

* [Parkrun Map](https://github.com/acurtis869/Parkrun-map)
  * A map to track and visualise the parkruns I have completed in London, organised by their respective boroughs and completion status.
  * Written in Python, utilising `geopandas`, `folium`, and `branca` libraries.
 
## Previous Projects

* [Word Segmentation in Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/acurtis869/Word-Segmentation-in-NMT)
  * My MSc dissertation topic, investigating different approaches to segment words to improve neural machine translation algorithms.
  * Programmed in Python and R and written up using LaTeX. Made use of `scipy`, `tensorflow`, `morfessor` and `sacrebleu` in Python and `tidyverse` in R.
* [Housing Price Prediction Model](https://github.com/acurtis869/housing-price-prediction)
  * A project as part of my Master's course. Using various machine learning techniques to build a model to predict house prices.
  * Programmed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Uses `scikit-learn`, along with `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.
* [Advanced Data Analysis](https://github.com/acurtis869/advanced-data-analysis)
  * Lab work from a university course, focusing on increasingly advanced methods of modelling a dataset.
  * Written in R, making use of many R packages including `glm`, `gstat`, `mgcv`, `splines`, `MuMIn`, and `fields`.
* [Hair Growth Analysis](https://github.com/acurtis869/hair-growth-analysis)
  * Analysing the efficacy of various hair growth treatments.
  * Written in SAS, mainly using the `GLM` and `TTEST` procedures.
* [Brexit Polling Analysis](https://github.com/acurtis869/brexit-polling-analysis)
  * Uses random sampling to investigate brexit polling data through parametric and non-parametric tests.
  * Written in R with the `tidyverse` library and `t.test` and `wilcox.test` functions.
* [Permutation Cipher Tool](https://github.com/acurtis869/permutation-cipher-tool)
  * Project for encrypting, decrypting, and attacking messages encrypted with a permutation cipher, created for a first year univeristy assignment.
  * Created in MATLAB with custom functions.
* [Survival Analysis](https://github.com/acurtis869/survival-analysis)
  * Code from a univeristy course focusing on survival analysis involving constructing a Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model.
  * Written in R using the `survival`, `survminer`, and `tidyverse` libraries.
* [Polynomial Evaluation and Sorting](https://github.com/acurtis869/polynomial-evaluation-and-sorting)
  * First year university coursework focusing on implementing and utilising polynomial evaluation through Horner's Rule.
  * Written in MATLAB with custom functions.
