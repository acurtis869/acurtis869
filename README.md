## Welcome to my GitHub

I am a passionate data analyst currently working at GLL in the Business Insights team in London. I have several years of professional experience within data and hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Bath and a Master's in Data Science from St Andrews University. My educational background has equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematical concepts and data science methodologies, which I apply to solve complex problems and derive actionable business insights. I enjoy learning and am committed to further self-development, currently working towards Microsoft Azure Data Engineering Certification.
